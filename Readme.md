# AWS Security Hardening and Optimization with Open-Source Tools

This project implements a modular, open-source security stack to harden and monitor AWS environments. It combines containerized services and scheduled CLI tools for runtime threat detection, compliance auditing, and policy enforcementâ€”all integrated into a centralized Wazuh dashboard. The full stack will be deployed using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and a CI/CD pipeline for automated service deployment and scheduled security scans.

In the opt folder is a more detailed Readme.md emphasizing the various steps, phases and processes.
